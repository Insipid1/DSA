#Programming Assignments
This repo has been created for completing **Assignment-2** of DSA(COMP-202) And will contain following programs and their repesctive readme files.
The following are the programming questions:
1. Write a program to check if any given mathematical expression ha balanced number of
parentheses or not?
Run the program by testing following expression-
⇒a + (b − c) ∗ (d
⇒m + [a − b ∗ (c + d ∗ {m)]
⇒a + (b − c)
Hint: Use stack

2. Write a program to convert an infix mathematical expression to postfix and evaluate it.
3. Write and Implement the reverse traversal algorithm in the the linked list. Write main() to
   demonstrate the use of the function.
4. How can we implement the doubly linked list using structure? Write a method to insert(after
   given node) and delete the node in doubly linked list. Write main() to demonstrate the use
   of the functions.
5. How can we implement the undirected graph using adjacency matrix? Write a function that
   implement the BFS and DFS technique to traverse through the graph. Demonstrate the
   use of your program with example graph.
6. Given the array of the data (unsorted), Write a program to build the min and max heap.
7. Given a weighted graph, implement Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path from a
   source node to all other nodes.
8. Write a program that generates a list of N random integers in the range [1, 1000], where N
  is provided by the user at run time. Then, perform the following tasks:
(a) Ask the user to choose a sorting algorithm from the following:
• Bubble Sort
• Selection Sort
• Insertion Sort
• Merge Sort
(b) Sort the randomly generated numbers using the chosen algorithm.
(c) Print the numbers before and after sorting.
(d) Display the total number of comparisons and swaps (if applicable) performed by the
chosen algorithm
